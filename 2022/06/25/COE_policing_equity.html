<p>We see that across race of the subject, the chief reason for the use of
force is Arrest, Active Aggression and Danger to self or others.</p>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We see that the number of of policing incidents have been steadily
decreasing over the year. They reached a peak in March and they went
on decreasing to a reach a minimum in December.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On looking at the time of reported incidents we see that most of
them are reported in the night that is from 9.00 PM to 6.00 AM in
the morning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the distribution of the incidents with respect to gender and
race of the officer we see that most of the male officer are in
majority.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of the gender, White officer has most of the incident
reported followed by Hispanic and Black officers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Across gender, most of the incidents have been reported at night.</p>

incidents the officers are not injured. However, among the injured
officers, White officer have been injured the most.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the distribution of incidents with regard to the race of
the subject and the time of day, we see that Black subjects are
mostly in incidences reported in the night or in the evening. There
are some case reported the afternoon, but very few in the morning.
Both White and Hispanic are active majorly in the night or evening.
But Hispanic are also active in the morning but White are active in
the afternoon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

find that in the Southeast, South Central, North East and Central
division majority of the incidents have Black subjects. In South
West, majority of the incidents involve Hispanic and Blacks. In
South Central is mostly black subjects. However in North Central and
Central there are a significant number of white subjects.</p>

arrested irrespective of the the race. Also irrespective of the race
of the officer, the subjects involved in the incident are black.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

Active Aggression and Danger to self or others are majorly citied
reasons across the race of the subjects.</p>
